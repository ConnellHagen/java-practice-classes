In Let America Be America Again, Langston Hughes argues that America was built off of good ideals, but has failed to make sure that the rights outlined by those ideals, like freedom, are provided to its citizens— especially due to the effects of oppression. This is first suggested with the line "America was never America to me" (line 5). This line implies that we consider there to be positive values behind America, but those values are not evident in the life of this particular speaker. Langston Hughes uses this concept of the secondary speaker in order to illustrate an important concept: that there are multiple disagreeing viewpoints Americans have on this topic. This speaker then uses the metaphor of a "false patriotic wreath" (line 12) in order to demonstrate that nationalism causes America to believe it is greater than it is. Like a wreath decorating a house, patriotism only changes how that "house" (America) is perceived, it is not related to the quality of what is actually in the house.

Langston Hughes uses the speaker in Let America Be America again to express poverty and capitalism as reasons for why America is not the free and equal society it portrays itself to be. Capitalism is criticized in lines like "Of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak" (line 24) which states that there is an oppression-causing class divide in America. The metaphor of ‘dog eat dog’ refers to the everyone-for-themselves individualist mentality that must arise for one to thrive in capitalist society. He also blames capitalism for causing an "endless chain" of greed in people in lines 25-30. As the young idealists fall victim to this systematic greed, they aren’t able to cause the necessary moral change they once believed in. This is connected with his description of poverty being a form of oppression with "Who said the free? not me?… who have nothing for our pay?" (lines 51-55). These lines also show frustration with years of trying to improve their conditions and leave poverty, but receiving nothing for their efforts. In lines 39-50, "Yet I’m the one who dreamt…To build a "homeland of the free."" uses irony by pointing out that the types of people currently facing this oppression, were the same types of people fleeing their countries to found America.

While this speaker has shown much frustration with America and the way it has caused him to be unfree, he does not wish death to it, but rather to improve it. This is first demonstrated by "The land that never has been yet…whose plow in the rain." (lines 63-68). The speaker states that he wishes for there to be a change that allows all people to be equal, so that the people who worked hard to build the country are treated how they deserve to be. The listing of the people who have worked hard to build the foundation of the country, as well as listing jobs like "hand at the foundry" and "plow in the rain" reflects a similar message to Walt Whitman’s poem "I Hear America Singing", which is to say that America thrives based on the hard work of ordinary Americans, not those who powerful. The sentiment of solidarity among those suffering in America is also reflected by "For those who live like leeches on the people’s lives, We must take back our land again." (lines 72-73). Once again, the problem outlined isn’t America itself, but those who have abused it in order to oppress and exploit others. There is an expressed desire to change the country instead of destroying it. Lastly, this sentiment is expressed by a statement of love for the beauty of the land itself, aside from the political and economic issues with "The land, the mines, the plants, the rivers… and make America again!" (lines 82-86).
