Peanuts. Of all ways to die, I am constantly threatened by an inanimate object. Everytime I leave my house, I always have to bring an EpiPen wondering if today is the day when I have to use it. Like many teenagers, food is a big part of my life. I eat 2 or 3 times as much as my brother and Mom, and yet never seem to significantly gain weight. Sometimes though, I am unable to enjoy eating like most people can though, as everytime I try something new, I have to check ingredients, ask someone what it contains, or just hope I don’t die. While I have luckily never had a dangerous reaction, I have had some really close calls. Not only that, but it is the cause of most of my anxiety when I was younger, alongside bees and flu shots. Now here’s a story that had a big impact on how I eat new foods.

I eat a lot. I mean, I eat like 1 or 2 meals worth of snacks at night. At a time there was a snack that I would eat all the time. Good old cheese crackers. "What could have nuts in cheese crackers?" you may ask, that’s what I thought too. I started my saturday with my normal Saturday routine, wake up at 6, grab 703 packs of cheese crackers, and go in the basement to play video games. I start playing my video games, eating my crackers, which I had eaten many times before, also had looked at ingredients first time buying them. Now randomly I saw the wrapper in the trash and thought, "haha what if it has nuts in it all of the sudden" which I knew it didn’t as I had checked the ingredients before, except that it did. Big and bold, Contains Peanuts. I couldn’t believe it, I didn’t misread may contain peanuts, or anything like that, it actually said contains peanuts. I started panicking, what would I do? I didn’t want to wake up my family, but I also wasn’t having a reaction, so I grabbed an EpiPen from upstairs and kept it close while doing my self-induced quick anxiety breathing. 
"Man did I screw up bad this time" I thought to myself. I had been afraid of needles since I was little, so knowing I may have to give myself a shot in a few minutes was too much for me to handle. I ended up panicking for nothing though, because for some reason I did not react.

Once my mom had woke up I explained what had happened, and we immediately got rid of the remaining crackers. We tried figuring out why I might not have reacted.
"Do you think you’re not allergic anymore?" My mom asked.
"Definitely not, there is no way I went from class 6 to none in a year."
"Do you think the package was a misprint?"
"I doubt it, that wouldn’t make much sense, but I don’t know what else the answer could possibly be".
She looked up if there was a similar thing that had happened to other people with the same brand of crackers online, apparently this had happened to many other people except they reported actually having a reaction. The one thing they all had in common was the sudden unmarked change in ingredients. What we figured out is that they were planning on changing the ingredients soon and marked the packages early so people would know ahead of time. That was a terrible strategy for many reasons, the worst reason being what I had to go through, in my opinion.

Overall from this experience, and scare, I will always make sure I know what is in everything that I eat to prevent an event like this in the future. It has greatly affected my life and is an event I will remember for a long time.
